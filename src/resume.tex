\section*{Life experience}

I started to tinker around my computer when I was about 6 years old, but started to make simple websites only at the age of 10, to learn the basics of web development. I began to gain interest in the C language and started to learn it at 14. Since I then saw the power that programming had, I was able to structure my mind and work more effectively in math and different school subjects. Since then, I've always been interested in learning more and more in technology and programming. I also discovered a passion for video editing and have been shooting and editing small videos in my spare time to keep me busy. Most of them are available on my YouTube channel: \url{https://youtube.com/philippeloctaux}
