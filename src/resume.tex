\section*{Life experience}

I started to tinker around my computer when I was about 6 years old, but started to make simple websites only at the age of 10, to learn the basics of web development. I began to gain interest in the C language and started to learn it at the age of 14. Since then I saw the power that programming had, it also helped me structure my mind and is helping me in math and different school subjects. Since then, I'm always interesting of learning more and more in technology and programming. I also discovered a passion for video editing, I’ve been shooting and editing small videos on my spare time to keep me busy. Most of them are available on my YouTube channel: \url{https://youtube.com/philippeloctaux}
